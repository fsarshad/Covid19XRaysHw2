# Introduction


# Overview 


# Steps 
1. Data Exploration
2. Split the Dataset
3. Fine-tune VGG-16, ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121
   i. Define Transformations
   ii. Handle imbalanced dataset with Weighted Random Sampling (Over-sampling)
   iii. Prepare the Pre-trained models
   iV. Fine-tune step with Early-stopping
   V. Plot running losses & accuracies
5. Results Evaluation
   i. Plot confusion matrices
   ii. Compute test-set Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1-score
   iii. Localize using Grad-CAM
5. Inference
